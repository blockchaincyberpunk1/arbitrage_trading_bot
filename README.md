## Description

  The Arbitrage Trading Bot exploits price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. It is implemented using Python, Pandas, and NumPy and interacts with the APIs of multiple exchanges like Binance. API keys are securely stored in a .env file.




## Installation

To run the Arbitrage Trading Bot, follow these steps:

Frontend Setup:
Open a terminal and navigate to the bot directory.

Run the following commands:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys securely:


BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
# Add keys for other exchanges if needed

Running the Bot:
In the same terminal, run the bot script:

python bot.py

The bot will start executing its arbitrage trading strategy based on the configuration in config.py.




Arbitrage Trading Bot is built with the following tools and libraries: <ul><li>Python: The programming language used for developing the bot's core functionality.</li> <li>Pandas: A popular data manipulation library in Python, used for processing and analyzing data.</li> <li>NumPy: A library for numerical computing, often used for mathematical operations.</li> <li>ccxt: A cryptocurrency exchange API library that facilitates interaction with multiple exchanges like Binance.</li></ul>





## Usage
 
The Arbitrage Trading Bot automatically exploits price differences between exchanges. Ensure you have configured the trading pairs and minimum price differences in config.py according to your desired strategy.
